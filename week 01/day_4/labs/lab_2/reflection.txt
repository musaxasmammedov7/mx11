1)Adaptation: How did your team adapt the Sprint Backlog when challenges arose?When The API delay(day3) and the Filter Bug(day4) happens,the didn't ignore them,we just changed the plan:When Filter bug was found by our team we decided to add new task to sprint backlog(Fix Filter Bug).And also after integration tests we saw that build data API is very slow, causing dashboard delays.So we decided to add task(Implement Simple Cache).The main point that helped us to make those desicions was Sprint Goal
 
2)Each participant knew what everyone else was working on, which prevented duplication of tasks in customizing the dashboard interface.Fo example on day 3 ,team could find the problem during stand up.It let us start the work as soon as possible.And also Daily Scrums helps to appoint mini goals for 1 day that help a lot for focusing a team.Let's talk about transparency.Let's use the same example (API) for clarity.Magomed openly disclosed the delay. Had he concealed it, the team would have continued to wait for the data, wasting time.

3)Firstly i want to say that sprint goal was set by all team members and our goal was to enable developers to effectively monitor, track, and investigate CI build statuses. When the team faced a bug in Story 3 and a delay on Story 2, the goal helped you decide which story was more important.And also Sprint goal provides freedom and flexibility.For example sprint backlogg told us that we had to complete all user's stories but sprint goal gave the team permission to let Story 3 slide back to the Product Backlog. Because you met the Goal (Monitoring and Investigation were enabled via Stories 1 and 2), the sprint was still a success.

4)Yes,it helpes a lot.The Definition of Done ensured that Done didn't just mean the code is written, but that it was actually ready for sending.Because  DoD required testing and code reviews, user stories 1 and 2 were delivered with high confidence.There were some tensions between quality and value.We moved story 3 back to the Product Backlog instead deliver it with bugs.Because we worked slower in order to maximize the value of features user's story 1 and 2.

5)How we showed it on the miro  we need to add Improve API Mocking to the top of the next backlog to prevent Day 3 delays from happening again.And also schedule at least 1 hour of pair programming per day for complex logic.

6)We also completely showed it on miro at retrospective frame.Commitment: Yes. The team stayed late to ensure the Investigate feature (Story 2) met the Definition of Done.Focus: Yes. Even when the bug appeared, the team focused on the Sprint Goal rather than getting distracted by low-priority tasks.Openness: Yes. Mahammad was open about the API delay on Day 3, which allowed the team to adjust early.Courage: Yes. The team had the courage to tell the Product Owner that Story 3 wasn't Done yet, rather than demoing a broken feature.Respect: Yes. Developers respected the tester’s decision to flag the bug, even though it meant Story 3 wouldn't be finished.
